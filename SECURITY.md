## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not** publicly disclose it by opening an issue.  
Instead, contact the maintainer privately:

- Email: sunkangnuaa@gmail.com
- Or via GitHub private message

I will do my best to respond within **3 days** and aim to resolve any confirmed vulnerabilities within **one week**.  
If the vulnerability is accepted, you will be notified after it is fixed.  
If the report is declined, I will provide an explanation.

Thank you for your responsible disclosure and for helping to keep this project secure!
